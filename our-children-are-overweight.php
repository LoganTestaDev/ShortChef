                  <p>Recently it was reported that obesity among kids reached unprecedented levels, especially in the United States. Many experts believe that 15% of our children are overweight 
                     and that at least another 15% to 20% are at risk of becoming so.
                  </p>
                  <h4>What causes our kids to be overweight?</h4>
                  <p>We all know the answer:<br>
                     Our kids spend less time exercising and more time watching TV, on the computer or playing video games; add that most of us are busy and unable to prepare balanced, nutritious meals. 
                     So what do we do? We grab something from the nearest fast food restaurant. But this is hurting our children.
                  </p>
                  <h4>What can we do to get our kids back in shape?</h4>
                  <ol>
                     <li>The most important thing that one can do is to change the family's lifestyle - yours and your kids.</li>
                     <li>A consistent healthy diet and regular exercise are all that is needed to lose weight and keep it off.</li>
                     <li>Parents must lead by example. Get the whole family involved in an exercise program of some sort; whether it's walking, biking, a game of basketball or even just a game of catch.</li>
                     <li>Start eating better and together. Get rid of the sodas and fast foods or at least, limit them.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>There is a lot of information on the Internet about preparing good meals, quickly.</p>
                  <h4>How do I start?</h4>
                  <p>First, get your children to their doctor. Discuss your children's eating and exercise habits with the physician and some positive changes that you can easily make. Your doctor 
                     may want to do some tests to see if your child has any of the medical conditions associated with obesity.
                     Depending on your doctor's evaluation, he or she may refer you to a registered dietitian for additional advice, or he may recommend a comprehensive weight management program.
